Introduction to Plugins
=======================

This readme is for administrators and/or moderators of Alice servers. If you are a developer please refer to `Plugins: developers' guide`.

## Where to get plugins

There is no central place to get Alice plugins as of yet. Most of the default plugins that do not require the `database` plugin should suffice for a very simple server setup. If you need a specific plugin then coding one is the only solution. Consult the `Plugins: developers' guide` if you are keen on developing your own plugins.
