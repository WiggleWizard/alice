Installing a plugin
===================

Put all plugins in the plugin folder in the root of Alice. The plugin folder path may vary however based on how Alice's config is set up. Consult your `config.ini` for the plugin path.

Plugins usually come in a folder, named after the plugin. Ensure that the folder contains at least a `plugin.py` file, which holds all core functionality for the plugin. There may be specific instructions for installing any 3rd party software in the readme that comes with the plugin.
